# covid_app

Started to learn basic things of coding in November 2019 In Hacktiv8. There, I learn about algorithms used in javascript. After taking Programming classes in Hacktiv8 and Graduated from Mechanical Engineering, I decided to take a full-stack class in Purwadhika Startup & Coding school in April 2020. Through time I realized that I have a strong passion for software engineering, so I started to learn flutter in March 2020 by myself. It was a real challenge for me, as a beginner who has minimum knowledge of programming language, to learn dart (flutter) and be able to implement its functionality to a real-world project in a short period of time. In the app, as you see on the demo video, you can check the active, deaths, and recovered cases even the details cases of coronavirus in each country. You can also search the countries. There are also symptoms and awareness about how to prevent the virus. I used flutter_bloc package as the state management for the app.
